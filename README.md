# Pianalytix Edutech Task

## Project Overview

**Frontend Development And API Integration:**
- Utilize HTML to structure the application's layout.
- Use CSS for styling the application. Feel free to use CSS frameworks like Bootstrap or Material-UI for design components.
- Implement the application logic using JavaScript (ES6 or later).

**React Components And Advanced State Management:**
- Develop the application using functional components and demonstrate the use of React hooks.
- The application should have at least two components:
  - TaskInput: A component for adding a new task.
  - TaskList: A component for displaying the list of tasks.


**Responsive Design:**
- Ensure the application is fully responsive and provides an excellent user experience on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices. Use CSS Grid and Flexbox to achieve responsiveness.
- Implement a mobile-first design approach.

**Functionality:**
- **Add Task**: Users should be able to input a task into a text field and add it to the list by pressing a button or pressing Enter.
- **View Tasks**: Display all added tasks in a list format.
- **Delete Task**: Each task should have a delete button that, when clicked, removes the task from the list.
- **Task Prioritization**: Allow users to set priorities for tasks (e.g., High, Medium, Low) and display them accordingly.
- **User Authentication**:
  - Add a simple user authentication feature (login/logout functionality) that simulates the process using Redux for state management. There's no need to integrate with a backend; you can mock the authentication process.
  - Protect the To-Do list behind authentication, ensuring that tasks are only visible to logged-in users.
